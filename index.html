    <p>Hello my fellow peep. My name is <b>Shlok Sheth</b>. I am a passionate coder who likes to read, play videogames,
        and have fun with friends playing sports like football and tennis.<br> I have coded many projects and know many
        languages such as HTML, which I am using to make this page right now, CSS, Javascript, and Python. My favorite
        food is cheese pizza and I also like Dabeli. <br> One of the things that I don't like are those coding games
        that make it seem like you are coding javascript or python but it is just you moving a character up and down. I
        also don't like scammers and cyberscamming companies. </p>
